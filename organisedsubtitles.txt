gerald
tates
here
he
wants
to
know
whats
happening
to
his
deal
go
get
harvey
i
check
raise
im
allin
you
can
pay
me
later
i
got
to
go
gentlemen
im
paying
you
millions
and
youre
telling
me
im
gonna
get
screwed
jessica
have
i
come
at
a
bad
time
gerald
this
is
harvey
specter
hes
our
best
closer
well
if
youre
the
best
closer
where
the
hell
you
been
for
the
last
three
hours
well
gerald
i
specialize
in
troubled
situations
and
when
i
left
here
at
pm
this
deal
wasnt
in
jeopardy
so
im
just
trying
to
figure
out
what
happened
in
the
interim
we
keep
offering
more
money
they
keep
rejecting
it
its
lastminute
bad
faith
bullsh
says
here
that
cooper
wont
be
staying
on
as
honorary
vice
president
thats
right
i
dont
want
him
around
he
wouldnt
be
around
its
an
honorary
position
i
dont
give
a
sh
well
i
think
you
do
because
thats
whats
changed
since
i
left
which
means
its
you
whos
been
dealing
in
bad
faith
well
now
that
youve
got
a
grasp
on
whats
happened
in
the
goddamn
interim
what
are
you
gonna
do
about
it
because
hes
not
getting
that
title
well
let
me
make
sure
i
understand
this
okay
we
negotiated
a
deal
that
gave
you
everything
you
wanted
mr
cooper
signed
it
and
now
you
wont
close
until
we
take
away
the
last
shred
of
his
dignity
bingo
well
thats
not
gonna
happen
and
why
the
hell
not
because
i
like
mr
cooper
and
my
firm
doesnt
operate
in
bad
faith
oh
i
see
how
it
is
instead
of
working
cooper
youre
working
me
well
why
dont
you
take
your
pansy
attitude
back
in
there
and
make
him
sign
my
deal
or
ill
pay
someone
else
your
money
to
do
it
for
me
first
of
all
gerald
if
you
think
anyones
gonna
touch
this
deal
after
your
bad
faith
youre
mistaken
second
the
way
our
agreement
works
is
the
minute
cooper
signed
the
deal
which
gave
you
everything
you
wanted
our
fee
was
due
and
payable
which
is
why
at
i
received
confirmation
of
a
wire
transfer
from
escrow
indicating
payment
in
full
so
id
say
the
balls
in
your
court
but
the
truth
is
your
balls
are
in
my
fist
now
i
apologize
if
that
image
is
too
pansy
for
you
but
im
comfortable
enough
with
my
manhood
to
put
it
out
there
now
get
your
ass
in
there
and
close
the
goddamn
deal
you
gonna
let
him
talk
to
me
like
this
harvey
speaks
for
the
firm
we
got
paid
before
gerald
signed
the
deal

are
you
talking
about
this
is

at
that
memo
because
a
charging
bull
always
looks
at
the
red
cape
not
at
the
man
with
the
sword
by
the
way
ive
set
up
a
meeting
for
you
and
john
dockery
next

dockery
hes
skaddens
biggest
client
not

hes
looking
around
he
plays
tennis
i
want
you

him
consider
it
done
then
you

officially
dismissed
for
the
evening
cheers
well
you

to
be
celebrating
something
mmhmm
we
are
in
fact
you
are
looking
at
the
best
closer
this
city
has
ever
seen
closer
huh
baseball
attorney
i
close
situations
hmm
so
you
only
care
about
money
the
truth
is
i
do
it
for
the
children
im
lisa
harvey
lisa
i
dont
normally
do
this
but
since
we
are
celebrating
what
time
do
you
get
off
tonight
im
glad
you
asked
i
get
off
at
ten
past
im
never
going
out
with
you
i
guess
youre
not
the
best
closer
this
citys
ever
seen
good
morning
lisa
this
was
lovely
but
im
afraid
you
have
to
go
aw
i
hate
to
miss
a
workout
and
i
really
need
to
be
in
the
office
by
cant
we
have
breakfast
you
could
eat
it
off
my
stomach
i
guess
if
i
skip
the
gym
i
can
still
get
in
by
i
hear
someones
not
taking
their
pills
because
theyre
trying
to
poison
me
grammy
thats
crazy
dr
shrager
gave
me
her
word
she
wouldnt
poison
you
until
january
if
she
does
it
before
then
she
cant
count
it
towards
next
years
quota
oh
what
did
i
teach
you
michael
im
not
gonna
be
around
forever
and
i
want
you
to
stop
with
that
stuff
what
stuff
i
may
be
old
but
im
not
an
idiot
i
know
life
has
been
hard
for
you
but
youre
not
a
kid
anymore
and
i
want
you
to
promise
youre
gonna
start
living
up
to
your
potential
i
promise
im
not
saying
that
i
havent
been
charmed
by
harvey
but
its
just
so
patronizing
when
you
say
that
he
can
handle
those
things
and
louis
you
can
only
handle
this
jessica
i
could
have
handled
gerald
tate
and
i
told
you
i
disagree
why
because
when
you
put
two
bullies
in
the
same
room
together
things
generally
dont
go
so
well
its
nice
of
you
to
show
up
two
hours
after
we
open
for
business
and
i
see
that
youre
also
trying
to
look
like
a
pimp
my
bad
louis
i
was
out
late
last
night
and
when
i
woke
up
this
is
the
suit
your
wife
picked
out
for
me
and
that
would
be
funny
if
id
actually
been
married
moving
along
youre
not
married
recruiting
harvey
your
interviews
are
set
up
for
tomorrow
what
why
dont
we
just
hire
the
harvard
summer
associate
douche
i
think
if
you
listen
to
the
phrasing
of
that
question
youll
come
up
with
an
answer
we
need
people
who
think
on
their
feet
not
another
clone
with
a
rod
up
his
ass
harvey
the
fact
that
we
only
hire
from
harvard
gives
us
a
cache
thats
a
little
more
valuable
than
hiring
a
kid
from
rutgers
you
went
to
harvard
law
im
an
exception
find
me
another
one
can
we
please
skip
the
recruiting
i
work
better
alone
anyway
well
i
would
harvey
except
all
senior
partners
get
an
associate
its
just
a
rule
im
sorry
what
jessica
i
deserve
that
promotion
my
billables
destroy
his
and
im
here
night
and
day
doing
whatevers
needed
instead
of
swanning
in
and
out
of
here
whenever
i
please
i
must
admit
he
does
make
me
sound
very
swanlike
harvey
shut
up
louis
this
is
how
it
is
all
right
now
you
two
make
nice
louis
i
apologize
i
was
out
of
line

pretend

ive
actually
passed
the
bar
id
say

full
of
crap
thats
a
barbri
legal
handbook
right
there
right
open
it
up
read
me
something
anything
civil
liability
associated
with
agency
is
based
on
several
factors
including
the
deviation
of
the
agent
from
his
path
the
reasonable
inference
of
agency
on
behalf
of
the
plaintiff
and
the
nature
of
the
damages
themselves
how
did
you
know
that
i
learned
it
when
i
studied
for
the
bar
okay
hotshot
fire
up
this
laptop
im
gonna
show
you
what
a
harvard
attorney
can
do
pick
a
topic
stock
option
backdating
although
backdating
options
is
legal
violations
arise
related
to
disclosures
under
irc
section
you
forgot
about
sarbanesoxley
the
statute
of
limitations
renders
sarbanesoxley
moot
post
not
if
you
can
find
actions
to
cover
up
the
violation
as
established
in
the
sixth
circuit
may
thats
impressive
but
youre
sitting
at
a
computer
playing
hearts
sorry
if
you
want
to
beat
me
youre
gonna
have
to
do
it
at
something
else
how
can
you
know
all
that
i
told
you
i
like
to
read
and
once
i
read
something
i
understand
it
and
once
i
understand
it
i
never
forget
it
why
take
the
bar
this
dickhead
bet
me
i
couldnt
pass
it
without
going
to
law
school
okay
look
this
is
all
pretty
fascinating
stuff
but
im
afraid
i
got
to
get
back
to
work
ill
make
sure
that
serpico
isnt
around
waiting
for
you
you
want
this
job
so
much
why
didnt
you
just
go
to
law
school
when
i
was
in
college
it
was
my
dream
to
be
a
lawyer
i
needed
some
money
and
trevor
convinced
me
to
memorize
this
math
test
and
to
sell
it
turns
out
we
sold
it
to
the
deans
daughter
i
lost
my
scholarship
i
got
kicked
out
of
school
i
i
got
knocked
into
a
different
life
and
i
have
been
wishing
for
a
way
back
ever
since
let
me
tell
you
something
this
isnt
elementary
school
this
is
hard
work
long
hours
high
pressure
i
need
a
grown
goddamn
man
you
give
me
this
and
i
will
work
as
hard
as
it
takes
to
school
those
harvard
douches
and
become
the
best
lawyer
you
have
ever
seen
im
inclined
to
give
you
a
shot
but
what
if
i
decide
to
go
another
way
id
say
thats
fair
sometimes
i
like
to
hang
out
with
people
who
arent
that
bright
you
know
just
to
see
how
the
other
half
lives
move
over
im
emailing
the
firm
i
just
found
our
next
associate
all
right

in
awe
of
him
they
say
hes
the
best
closer
there

and
what
about

jimmy
have
you
lost
weight
steveo
looking
like
a
guy
who
came
to
work
excuse
me
why
are
you
scratching
off
the
senior
off
my
door
i
got
a
work
order
to
take
it
off
who
issued
the
work
order
my
supervisor
why
did
he
issue
the
work
order
if
i
knew
that
id
be
his
supervisor
you
seem
to
be
enjoying
yourself
i
havent
enjoyed
myself
since
donna
someones
trying
to
have
a
little
fun
with
me
here
jessica
wants
to
see
you
in
her
office
now
and
finally
this
is
where
youll
live
wow
i
gave
you
that
for
a
reason
you
havent
taken
one
note
thats
because
because
you
were
too
busy
ogling
me
to
listen
to
a
word
ive
said
partners
offices
anchor
the
wings
fifth
floors
research
sixth
is
security
all
work
gets
billed
even
if
its
finding
an
address
i
answer
to
harvey
and
louis
litt
and
judging
by
the
way
you
responded
to
my
questions
i
should
admire
harvey
and
i
should
fear
louis
you
have
been
here
for
five
years
and
just
because
i
outrank
you
does
not
mean
i
have
the
authority
to
command
your
services
oh
its
also
pretty
clear
that
you
think
youre
too
smart
to
be
a
paralegal
you
know
what
nobody
likes
nobody
likes
a
showoff
you
used
the
word
ogling
when
do
i
get
to
see
harvey
gerald
tate
fired
the
firm
so
youre
taking
my
promotion
away
you
know
most
firms
would
put
you
in
front
of
the
bar
and
have
your
license
stripped
you
lied
to
a
client
and
he
figured
it
out
i
lied
to
him
to
get
him
to
do
the
right
thing
and
honor
his
goddamn
contract
and
you
didnt
seem
to
mind
so
much
when
you
thought
i
got
away
with
it
but
you
didnt
get
away
with
it
and
i
cant
justify
handing
you
a
promotion
on
the
same
day
that
you
lose
a
huge
client
one
client
doesnt
make
a
firm
i
dont
know
if
youve
noticed
but
were
in
the
middle
of
an
economic
meltdown
companies
arent
exactly
lining
up
to
spend
money
on
attorneys
right
now
and
you
know
gerald
might
have
forgiven
the
lying
had
you
not
humiliated
him
but
you
did
and
you
need
to
accept
that
jessica
if
you
hadnt
done
as
much
for
me
as
you
have
id
be
heading
for
the
door
if
i
hadnt
done
as
much
for
you
as
i
have
id
be
throwing
you
out
the
window
but
harvey
no
more
shenanigans
you
do
one
more
thing
that
isnt
straight
as
an
arrow
and
instead
of
covering
your
ass
i
will
put
you
in
front
of
the
bar
myself
mike
hey
whos
ready
for
a
great
first
day
im
gonna
have
to
let
you
go
what
i
just
got
reamed
for
lying
to
a
client
and
if
they
find
out
that
i
lied
about
you
going
to
harvard
theyll
take
away
my
license

not
now
donna
look
i
have
to
put
my
own
interests
above
yours
its
nothing
personal
youre
fired
wait

youre
worried
that
if
i
stay
then
they
might
find
out
that
you
lied
about
me
and
youll
lose
your
license
but
if
you
fire
me
then
i
could
tell
them

lied
about
me

youd
definitely
lose
your
license

you
telling
me
that
if
i
throw
you
under

myself
a
job
as
a
secretary
at
devlin
mcgreggor
and
i
even
got
promoted
to
secretary
of
the
president
charles
hunt
and
thats
when
it
all
changed

me
what
happened
he
started
asking

support
my
claim
two
months
later
i
was
fired
for
poor
job
performance
they
wouldnt
let
me
say
goodbye
to
anybody
they
wouldnt
write
me
a
letter
of
recommendation
i
wasnt
looking
for
a
payoff
all
i

youre
asking
to
look
at
private
files
without
any
evidence
of
your
assertion
yeah
but
the
only
way
that
we
can
find
the
evidence
is
to
look
at
those
files
its
a
rickety
argument
but
is
there
a
precedent
lets
go
see
if
we
can
find
one
research
is
as
much
art
as
science
so
were
gonna
look
at
privacy

harassment
law

you
can
find
a
combination
of
cases

make
an
argument

take
privacy
ill
take
harassment
law

too
smart
to
be
a
paralegal
mmhmm
why

i
a
lawyer
mm
i
dont
test
well
what
i

smart
and
i

id
be
a
good
lawyer
i
justi
dont
know
what
it
is
i
cant
take
tests
and
i
bombed
the
lsats
and
even
if
i
could
get
into
law
school
theres
no
way
id
pass
the
bar
so
if
only
there
was
someone
who
could
take
the
test
for
me
yeah
if
only
there
were
yeah
hi
where
are
you
at
with
the
research
for
tomorrows
hearing
nothing
yet
you
say
you
care
about
the
client
but
if
you
keep
playing
footsie
instead
of
finding
me
an
argument
the
clients
gonna
lose
i
dont
want
to
lose
ugh
look
its
no
use
okay
their
investigations
by
the
book
we
look
like
the
bad
guys
coming
in
putting
them
under
duress
what
did
you
just
say
i
said
we
look
like
the
bad
guys
no
you
said
they
did
it
by
the
book
and
were
putting
them
under
duress
yeah
look
hmm
this
is
good
were
gonna
have
some
fun
we
i
get
to
go
you
didnt
think
id
let
you
come
along
no
good
instinct
i
wasnt
but
then
i
thought
itd
be
cruel
not
to
let
you
witness
my
greatness
okay
can
i
go
get
my
bag
no
youre
a
true
giver
other
side
okay
your
honor
this
case
should
be
thrown
out
other
than
her
story
the
plaintiff
doesnt
have
one
piece
of
evidence
because
the
evidence
lies
within
their
personnel
files
which
theyre
conveniently
refusing
to
hand
over
those
files
contain
sensitive
information
hes
fishing
at
the
expense
of
our
employees
right
to
privacy
please
they
dont
give
a
rats
ass
about
his
employees
right
to
privacy
sorry
thats
actually
unfair
to
rats
asses
your
honor
mr
specters
claim
that
we
dont
care
about
our
employees
though
belittling
doesnt
carry
any
weight
as
a
rule
of
law
true
but
what
does
carry
weight
is
that
an
investigation
of
sexual
harassment
must
be
conducted
without
any
duress
your
point
the
investigator
and
every
person
being
interviewed
answers
to
the
ceo
theyre
investigating
that
is
the
definition
of
duress
itd
be
as
if
your
bailiff
accused
you
of
sexual
harassment
and
you
assigned
your
stenographer
to
investigate
now
how
likely
would
it
be
that
this
investigation
yielded
any
fruit
you
honestly
think
i
would
harass
herman
well
i
dont
know
your
honor
some
people
have
a
thing
for
the
uniform
ugh
id
like
to
think
herman
would
come
to
me
before
it
even
got
to
an
investigation
i
saw
that
that
should
be
stricken
but
what
if
herman
did
come
to
you
your
honor
and
you
betrayed
his
trust
by
firing
him
under
false
pretenses
you
really
think
that
little
of
me
i
wouldnt
trust
you
as
far
as
i
could
throw
you
your
honor
hand
over
the
files
oh
today
thats
it
herman
id
like
to
speak
to
you
in
chambers
that
was
awesome
it
was
your
argument
i
just
framed
it
in
a
way
that
humanized
the
situation
and
brightened
all
of
our
afternoons
i
feel
like
michael
corleone
in
that
scene
where
that
fat
guy
teaches
him
how
to
shoot
that
gun
are
you
saying
that
im
the
fat
guy
cause
im
not
the
fat
guy
mm

know
what
his
name
was
yeah
cordoza
clemenza
i
knew
that
i
was
just
testing
to
see

with
me
the
next
day
i
requested
a
change
in
assignment
two
months
later
i
was
fired
for
having
a
bad
attitude
this
is
ridiculous
wipe
that
smirk
off
your
face
youre
not
even
supposed
to
be
here
mr
hunt
has
every
right
to
be

now
ms

arrested
dont
contact
me
again
please
what
happened
with
the
witness
nothing
nothing
happened
i
couldnt
fix
it
so
youre
going
to
quit
its
either
that
or
have
louis
litt
fire
me
what
are
you
talking
about
my
first
day
louis
fired
gary
lipsky
for
screwing
up
a
case
he
said
if
i
did
the
same
thing
id
be
gone
just
as
fast
well
you
go
back
to
the
witness
house
and
you
get
her
to
testify
again
i
tried
theres
no
way
theres
always
a
way
then
why
dont
you
go
and
convince
her
because
you
screwed
it
up
oh
and
you
dont
give
a
damn
about
the
client
right
thats
not
my
job
does
your
job
include
giving
a
damn
about
me
because
the
least
you
could
do
is
offer
to
stand
up
to
louis
for
me
stand
up
for
you
i
put
my
ass
on
the
line
for
you
but
it
turns
out
you
may
have
had
the
balls
to
get
this
job
but
you
dont
have
the
courage
to
stick
it
out
when
it
gets
tough
thats
not
true
isnt
it
youve
had
one
foot
out
the
door
since
you
got
here
what
are
you
talking
about
im
talking
about
that
briefcase
being
locked
in
your
desk
yeah
i
saw
it
and
i
know
what
it
is
its
your
backup
plan
in
case
this
doesnt
work
out
you
can
make
some
quick
cash
and
go
right
back
to
the
life
you
told
me
you
didnt
want
to
lead
so
if
you
want
to
quit
go
ahead
but
this
isnt
because
of
louis
and
it
isnt
because
of
me
its
because
youre
afraid
you
might
have
to
admit
that
youre
not
as
smart
as
you
think
you
are
if
youre
here
in

to
do
press
until

hurts
wire

joanna
webster
prior
to
her
testimony
and
an
affidavit
stating
you
paid
ms
webster
to
falsely
testify
mr
hunt
harassment
is
a
civil
violation
the
penalty
is
money
but
witness
tampering
thats
a
crime
and
you
will
go
to
prison
where
i
guarantee
youll
learn
more
about
unwanted
sexual
advances
than
you
can
possibly
imagine
do
you
think
this
is
going
to
intimidate
me
even
if
this
evidence
was
credible
who
are
you
going
to
get
to
prosecute
a
smalltime
witness
tampering
charge
huh
harvey
didnt
you
graduate
law
school
with
the
current
us
attorney
in
new
york
in
fact
i
did
and
i
think
he
might
even
be
interested
in
pursuing
a
case
like
this
wait
are
you
two
still
close
well
i
was
the
best
man
at
his
wedding
wow
no
you
werent
youre
bluffing
no
i
think
ive
got
some
pictures
of
us
at
the
ceremony
lets
see
yeah
here
we
are
you
must
admit
i
look
very
dashing
this
is
me
and
his
mother
the
woman
adores
me
here
we
are
at
his
bachelor
party
theres
no
strippers
it
was
lame
but
he
cant
put
guys
like
you
away
for
sexual
harassment
and
then
go
to
strip
clubs
now
can
he
all
right
what
do
you
want
an
admission
of
guilt
and
a
guarantee
that
youll
obtain
treatment
before
working
again
and
nancy
gets
reinstated
with
back
pay
fine
and
a
raise
okay
all
right
are
we
done
the
kid

be
able
to
grow
up
without
the
burden
of
tuition
hanging
over
his
head
dont
you
think
which
is
why
youre
also
gonna
pay
nancy
an
extra
charles
gentlemen
thank
you
for
everything

just
one
question
whyd

my
job

you
admit
it
you
care
about
me
i
saw

didnt

i
was
thinking
of
a
funny
joke

mean

officially
a
team
